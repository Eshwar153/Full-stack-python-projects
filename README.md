 Hi, I’m Thayumanavan — a passionate and results-driven Full Stack Developer with strong expertise in both Python and .NET technology stacks.

 With hands-on experience across the full software development lifecycle, I specialize in building scalable, high-performance web applications using Django, Flask, and ASP.NET Core on the backend, and React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap on the frontend.

💡 Whether it's designing RESTful APIs, managing complex databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server, or developing modern user interfaces, I aim to create solutions that are not only functional but also intuitive and user-friendly.

✔️ Key Skills:

Full Stack Development (Python/Django/Flask | ASP.NET Core/C#)

Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap

Backend: REST APIs, Authentication, MSSQL & MYSQL Databases
